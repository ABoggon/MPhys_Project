Repository for MPhys project report appendix videos. 

This ReadMe describes the contents of these videos.

1. Whole_Milk.avi:

Video of a sample of whole milk constructed from cryogenic scanning electron microscopy images. Serial slices were taken at 31.5nm intervals with each image having dimensions 15284×11463nm. There are 121 frames in this video.


2. Skimmed_Milk.avi:

Video of a sample of skimmed milk constructed from cryogenic scanning electron microscopy images. Serial slices were taken at 31.5nm intervals with each image having dimensions 44684×33447nm. There are 182 frames in this video.


3. Fat_Globule_3D_Model.avi:

A video of a 3 dimensional model of the fat globules present in a sample of whole milk. The model was created by segmenting the serial slices taken from the cryo-SEM experiment and reconstructing them using the Avizo software.
