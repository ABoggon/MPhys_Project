Repository for MPhys project report appendix videos. 

This ReadMe describes the contents of these videos.

1. Whole_Milk.avi:

Video of a sample of whole milk constructed from cryogenic scanning electron microscopy images. Serial slices were taken at 31.5nm intervals with each image having dimensions 15284×11463nm. There are 121 frames in this video. The image area changes as the video progresses because these images have been aligned to account for drift during the imaging.


2. Skimmed_Milk.avi:

Video of a sample of skimmed milk constructed from cryogenic scanning electron microscopy images. Serial slices were taken at 31.5nm intervals with each image having dimensions 44684×33447nm. There are 182 frames in this video. The images drift as the video progresses, this is because the SEM imaging beam is not drift corrected but the FIB milling beam is. Therefore, the milling still occurs straight in to the sample but the imaging region drifts.


3. Fat_Globule_3D_Model.avi:

A video of a 3 dimensional model of the fat globules present in a sample of whole milk. The model was created by segmenting the serial slices taken from the cryo-SEM experiment and reconstructing them using the Avizo software.
